Jekyll is a simple, extendable, static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it churns through layouts to create a static website. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more.

## Using with Drupal

* [Drupal 7 Importer](https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/drupal7/) - currently no completed Drupal 8 importer exists.

* Any custom approach to export Drupal data as Yaml, Json, or CSV can then be consumed by Jekyll.

* [Views Data Export](https://www.drupal.org/project/views_data_export) (or similar) to export data for use with the [Jekyll CSV importer](https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/csv/)

* Create a Drupal generated RSS feed to export data for use with the [Jekyll ESS importer](https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/rss/)
