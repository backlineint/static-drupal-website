Tome is a static site generator for Drupal 8, and a static storage system for content.

When Tome is enabled, any changes to config, content, or files will be automatically synced to your local filesystem. These exports can be used to fully rebuild the site from scratch, which removes the need for a persistent SQL database or filesystem. When you're ready to push to production, you can use Tome to generate a static HTML version of your site.

## Using with Drupal
