## Approaches

There are a few main categories of approaches to creating static sites based on Drupal data.

### Using Drupal

Projects like [Tome](https://tome.fyi) are Drupal projects that provide an option to export a static version of the site..

### Pre-packaged importers

[Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/) offers the [gatsby-source-drupal](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-drupal/) plugin that imports data from a JSON API endpoint for example.

### Generic Drupal Export

Custom code can be used to export data from Drupal into formats like Markdown, JSON, or CSV which can then be used with many static site generators. See [Drupal Serialization Step-by-Step](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/drupal-serialization-step-by-step) as an example. [Tome](https://tome.fyi) can also be used to export Drupal data as JSON for use with other static site generators.
